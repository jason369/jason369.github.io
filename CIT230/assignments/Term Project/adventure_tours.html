                <h3>Details of Each Day</h3>
                <div id="accordion">
                    <h3>Day 1</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Pedal beside the Cusick River and the million-acre Colville National Forest, home to the last remaining herd of caribou in the U.S. The Selkirk Mountains range - pardon the pun - into eastern Washington, northern Idaho and southeastern British Columbia. Today: Ride 50 scenic miles beside the Cusick River as it winds through Colville National Forest, a million-acre-plus legacy from Theodore Roosevelt's presidency. This ride is one of the Top 10 Scenic Routes in the Northern Rockies. Stop now and then for a handful of wild huckleberries while you count the bald eagles and savor the amazing views.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 2</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Ride into Rossland, British Columbia, 'Mountain Bike Capital of Canada.' It's also home turf to Red Mountain Resort and several Olympic gold medalists. Ride a challenging, hilly 60-ish miles north and across the Canadian border today. Just across the border sits tiny Rossland. Thousands of skiers and snowboarders descend on its Red Mountain Resort each winter - some with names you'll recognize: Dallas Drake, retired NHL Hockey player; Kerrin Lee-Gartner, downhill skier and Nancy Greene, downhill skier and Olympic Gold medalist. Summer finds it full of wildflowers, expansive views and a giant network of technical high alpine singletrack revered by mountain bikers. </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 3</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Pedal along the border today to Nelson, British Columbia, beloved by draft-dodgers for epic rock-climbing and expansive views of the Kootenay Mountain Range. Ride 60+ miles today, from Rossland along the southern British Columbia border into the artsy cultural centre of Nelson. Once a silver mining town, then a logging town, Nelson became a haven for well-educated draft-dodgers who were willing to put down roots. Top that off with an extensive network of mountain-bike trails, rock-climbing and bouldering hotspots, and you've got a smart, hip and very fit population. Plus a great brewery. </p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 4</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Hop a ferry. Back on land, ride to Creston, BC via Kootenay Lake = 65 miles of spectacular. This morning, hop aboard a ferry to sail from Nelson to Creston across Kootenay Lake, tucked between the Selkirk and Purcell mountain ranges. It's one of the largest lakes in the province, home to largemouth bass, Dolly Varden trout and Kokanee salmon. There were no paved roads into this spectacular region until the mid-1960s. Watch for the Boswell Glass House - built entirely of bottles! - and spectacular views of the Kokanee Glacier. This afternoon, shuttle back across the border to Sand Point, Idaho. </p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 5</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Explore Sandpoint, Idaho. USA Today named it the nation's "Most Beautiful Small Town." Surrounded by the Selkirk, Cabinet and Bitterroot ranges, Sandpoint is home to Schweitzer Mountain Ski Resort, Idaho's second largest after Sun Valley. Ride, hike, golf, fish, go rock climbing: take your pick from a bevy of options today. </p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 6</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Ride south: quiet, scenic roads lead to the beautiful resort town of Coeur d但lene, Idaho. Sixty-five miles of scenic side roads wind south to the idyllic resort town of Coeur d但lene. Early French-speaking fur traders called the local peoples the Coeur d'Alene (translation: "awl heart," meaning 'sharp-hearted' or 'shrewd'). Twenty-five-mile long Coeur d'Alene Lake is one of the most spectacular places in the Idaho Panhandle. It's the perfect place to watch tonight's sunset. </p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 7</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Ride the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes before heading back to Spokane for your homeward flight. The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes bike path follows the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way along the shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene into the Chain Lakes region and the historic Silver Valley. You won't have time to ride the whole 73-mile stretch today but the out-and-back is still a perfect finale. And it gives you a reason to come back. </p>

                <h3>Details of Each Day</h3>
                <div id="accordion2">
                    <h3>Day 1</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Pedal a tranquil 40 miles to Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho - along the riverfront Spokane Centennial Trail and the North Idaho Centennial Trail. This afternoon: enjoy the lake! From Spokane's Riverfront Park, ride the paved Spokane Centennial Trail beside the Spokane River to the intersection with the North Idaho Centennial Trail. Between the two, it's possible to ride from Spokane, Washington to beautiful Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, cycling for miles without seeing a car. Spend the next three nights at the grand Roosevelt Inn, originally the area's first permanent schoolhouse. Take time for a dip in the lake before dinner - it's just a short walk from the inn. </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 2</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>The Hiawatha Trail: ride over the rivers and through the woods on what was once touted as 'one of the most scenic stretches of railroad in the country.' Another fantastic rails-to-trails project, the Route of the Hiawatha Trail was originally hailed as one of the most scenic stretches of railroad in the country. When the Milwaukee Railroad was operating, the trains traversed through 11 tunnels and over 9 trestles, covering a route across the rugged Bitterroot Mountains between Idaho and Montana. The "Route of the Hiawatha" is most famous for the long St. Paul Pass, or Taft Tunnel which burrows for 8771 ft. (1.66 miles) under the Bitterroot Mountains at the state line. Enjoy the stellar views on a blissfully car-free day!

                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 3</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>From the Cataldo Mission, bike the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes and cruise the shores of the lake. Ride from the oldest standing building in Idaho - the Cataldo Mission, established in the early 1840s - to The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes. A former Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way, today's paved trail was originally a path traveled by the Coeur d'Alene Indians. Ultimately it became a rail line carrying silver and lead ore from mines in Mullan, Burke and Kellogg to terminals on the Palouse prairie from 1887 to 1992; today it's worth its weight in gold as a scenic bikeway. Pedal through old growth forest, beneath mountain vistas and beside the shores of glorious Lake Coeur d'Alene. </p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Day 4</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Explore a bit more of the lake hailed by National Geographic as 'one of the world's most beautiful.' Continue exploring the shores of Lake Coeur d’Alene by bike. Once described by National Geographic as one of the five most beautiful lakes in the world - and boasting 109 miles of shoreline - we’ve only just rippled the surface. Spot bald eagles hunting kokanee in the lake’s sparkling waters. Soak up the friendly small-town charm of Coeur d’Alene before heading back to Spokane.
